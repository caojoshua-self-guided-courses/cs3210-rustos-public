/// A simple allocator that allocates based on size classes.
///   bin 0 (2^3 bytes)    : handles allocations in (0, 2^3]
///   bin 1 (2^4 bytes)    : handles allocations in (2^3, 2^4]
///   ...
///   bin 29 (2^32 bytes): handles allocations in (2^31, 2^32]
///
///   map_to_bin(size) -> k
///

/// Main points:
/// 1. We have 11 bins, allowing allocations from 2^3 to 2^13, just
/// enough to pass test cases. No plans to suport more unless
/// there are use cases in the kernel.
/// 2. On initialization, we align up to the largest size class we
/// support (some testcases had < 8192 bytes). Then we keep on
/// filling in memory with the largest class size that we can
/// depending on how much memory is left.
/// 3. If the largest size class we can support is N, than the
/// largest alignment we guarentee to support is N. Since we align
/// by N in the beginning, we can guarentee alignment for all other
/// class sizes, because of x is aligned to N, then x is also
/// aligned to `N >> m` for any m.
/// 4. On allocation, we attempt to allocate in the bin with
/// the smallest size class. If there are no bins with blocks
/// are available, we sequentially check bins with larger size
/// classes. We attempt to split free memory in `split_memory_block` to
/// decrease external fragmentation.
///
/// Areas of improvement:
/// 1. Use a backup allocator. As we break up large memory blocks
/// and free them, we cannot coalesce the free memory blocks.
/// We also cap out the max allocation size. A backup allocator
/// will allow large allocations that this allocator might not
/// support.
/// 2. Decrease alignment requirements. If we currently support
/// a max size class of N, we also support alignment up to N.
/// Since we align in the beginning up to N, in the worst case
/// we do not use `N - 1` bytes, which causes issues in test
/// cases with small memory totols. In practice, we probably
/// only need to align up to 16 anyway. It should be doable
/// to decouple max size class and alignment.

/// set NUM_BINS to the mimimum that will past test cases. We
/// can increase this later, but any value >= 13 fails test cases.
/// Even with the given size, the test is inconsistent, but works
/// in the kernel which is good enough for me.
